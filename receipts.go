// Receipts are line-item purchase data added to a transaction. They contain all the information about the purchase,
// including the products you bought, any taxes that were added on, and how you paid.
// They can also contain extra details about the merchant you spent money at, such as how to contact them,
// but this may not appear in the app yet.
